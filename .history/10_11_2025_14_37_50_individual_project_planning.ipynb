    "I would like to address the broad question of which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data to the research so that they can be targeted in recruitement efforts. Specifically, I am interested in the question: can player gender can be predicted from number of hours of PLAICraft played and player age from the players.csv dataset? The players.csv data will help me answer this questions by supplying data from which I can create a classification model to visualize and predict whether there is a relationship between hours played + age and gender of players (i.e. which gender tends to spend the most time on the game). I would use the \"played_hours\" and \"Age\" variables as predictors, and the \"gender\" variable as the classification label. \n"
