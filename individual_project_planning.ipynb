    "I would like to address the broad question of which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data to the research so that they can be targeted in recruitement efforts. Specifically, I am interested in the question: can player gender can be predicted from number of hours of PLAICraft played in the players.csv dataset? The players.csv data will help me answer this questions by supplying data from which I can create a classification model to visualize and predict whether there is a relationship between hours played and gender of players (i.e. which gender tends to spend the most time on the game). I would use the \"played_hours\" variable as the predictor, and the \"gender\" variable as the classification label. **[You may need to describe how you plan to wrangle your data to get it into a form where you can apply one of the predictive methods from this class.]**"
