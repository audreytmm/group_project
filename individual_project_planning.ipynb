    "My answer requires a knn-classification model using the players.csv dataset. This model is appropriate because I am using a quantitative variable (hours_played) to predict a character vector (gender). The requires the assumption that the genders correctly represent who was playing in a given observation. Potential issues/limitations include the dataset being to small to capture an interpretable trend, and the classifying labels being unbalanced; I will thus pre-balance the data. I will then randomly (reproduceably) split the data into 0.75 training and 0.25 testing proportions, as this is a split we have commonly used in this cousre. I am going to use cross-validation to select the correct model, seeing what k gives the best prediction accuracy on training data. I will use 5 folds and a reproduceably random validation set. This will occur after pre-processing but before determining the best k.  \n"
